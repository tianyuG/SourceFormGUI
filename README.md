> Source Form is a standalone device capable of collecting crowdsourced images of a user-defined object, stitching together available crowdsourced visual data through photogrammetry and 3D printing a physical form. This is a porthole through which the immense breadth and growth of the collective internet image database will be translated to its own contributors; the public.

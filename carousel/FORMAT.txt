The format of this JSON file:

{
	"0000": {											<- [1]
		"title": "Statue of Liberty",					<- [2]
		"thumbnail": "imgs\0000.jpg",					<- [3]
		"path": "C:\\Users\\test\\projects\\liberty"	<- [4]
	},
	...
}

[1]:	ID of the model described in this stacked JSON file. 
			Ideally sequential, but not identical.
[2]:	The _relative_ path to the thumbnail of this model
[3]:	The _absolute_ path to the folder that contains the point cloud file
			(fused.ply) and the downloaded images. For best performance,
			this path should not be a network location.
